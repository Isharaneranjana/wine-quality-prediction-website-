# wine-quality-prediction-website

The project was done to predict the quality of wine using machine learning and deep learning techniques. we were able to get an accuracy of 87% which outperformed many of the related work on this dataset. There was the effect of class imbalance and to overcome that synthetic minority oversampling(SMOTE) technique was used. Finally the developed model was deployed to a website using flask.
